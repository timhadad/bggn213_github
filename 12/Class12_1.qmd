Q13: Read this file into R and determine the sample size for each genotype and their corresponding median expression levels for each of these genotypes.

# Sample size
A/A A/G G/G 
108 233 121

#Median 
A/A      A/G      G/G 
31.24847 25.06486 20.07363 

```{r}
data <- read.table("rs8067378_ENSG00000172057.6.txt")
head(data)
```

```{r}
nrow(data)
```

```{r}
table(data$geno)
```

```{r}
tapply(data$exp, data$geno, median)
```



#Q14: Generate a boxplot with a box per genotype, what could you infer from the relative expression value between A/A and G/G displayed in this plot? Does the SNP effect the expression of ORMDL3

#
There is clear difference between the med lines of G/G and A/A. A/A is more expressed than G/G shwoing the effect of SNP on ORMDL3

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(geno, exp)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```
